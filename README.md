## üîß Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v22.20.0 or higher)
- **npm**

### Project Setup

1.  **Navigate to the server directory:**

        cd server

2.  **Install dependencies:**

        npm install

3.  **Navigate to the client directory:**

        cd client

4.  **Install dependencies:**

        npm install

5.  **Rename the given `.env.txt` file to `.env` and place it in the server directory:**

6.  **Navigate to the root directory**:

        cd ../

7.  **Install dependencies:**

        npm install

8.  **Start the development server:**

        npm run dev

    The server and frontend will start at `http://localhost:8000` and `http://localhost:5173` respectively.

### Database Seeding (Optional):

If you want to populate the database with sample data (however i have already done this step there is no need to do it):

1.  **Navigate to the server directory:**

        cd server

2.  **Run the seed script:**

        npm run seed

    This will create:
    - **8 sample products** (T-shirt, Jeans, Sneakers, Laptop, Smartphone, Coffee Mug, Book, Headphones)
    - **3 discount rules** (BOGO on T-shirts, Buy 2 Sneakers for 1, 50% off Clothing)

    Or seed individually:

        npm run seed:products    # Seed products only
        npm run seed:discounts   # Seed discounts only

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT tokens** stored in **httpOnly cookies** for security
- **Role-based access control** (User vs Admin)
- **Password hashing** with bcryptjs
- **Admin key** required for admin registration (admin123) to register as an admin
- **Protected routes** on both frontend and backend
- **Automatic redirection** based on user role

## üí° Discount System Logic

### BOGO (Buy One Get One)

- Every 2nd item is free
- Example: Buy 3 T-shirts, pay for 2

### Buy X for Y

- Buy X quantity, pay for Y quantity
- Example: Buy 2 Sneakers, pay for 1

### Percentage Off

- Fixed percentage discount
- Can be product-specific or category-wide
- Example: 50% off all Clothing

### Priority

1.  Product-specific discounts (checked first)
2.  Category-wide discounts (if no product discount)
3.  Only one discount applied per product
